This Project was built by following the repo of: https://github.com/iusztinpaul/hands-on-llms. please refer to it from more info its a great resource to learn LlmOps.

In a real production environment each module will be in its own environment, for demonstration and ease of sharing and access purpose I have compiled and shared all the modules in a single repo.
